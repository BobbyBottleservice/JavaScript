Using the JavaScript language, have the function simpleSymbols take the str parameter being passed and determine if it is an acceptable sequence by either returning the string true or false.  The str parameter will be composed of + and = symbols with several letters between them ( ie. ++d+===+c++==a ) and for the string to be true each letter must be surrounded by a + symbol.  So the string to the left would be false.  The string will not be empty and will have at least one letter.

function simpleSymbols ( str ) {

	var pattern = /[^a-zA-Z0-9\s\+\=]/gi; //RegEx pattern that includes + and = in the pattern
	var newString = str.replace(pattern,""); //Replace all chars as specified by RegEx with nothing
	
	for ( var i = 0; i < newString.length; i++ ) { //loop through new string
		if ( newString.charAt(i) != "+" && newString.charAt(i) != "=" ) { //Using charAt test for a char vs. ( + or = )
			var index = newString.indexOf(newString.charAt(i)); // If char is found log the index
			
			if ( newString.charAt( index - 1 ) == "+" && newString.charAt( index + 1 ) == "+" ) { 
				//If the char before the index && after the index are indeed + then return true
				return true;
			} else {
				return false;
			}
		}
	}

};

/*As of now, the program does not work 100% as intended because it returns true as soon as the +n+ requirement is met
thus ignoring the rest of the string making patterns such as "++d+===+c++==a" return true*/
