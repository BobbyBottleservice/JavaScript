Using the JavaScript language, have the function timeConvert take the num parameter being passed and return the number of hours and minutes the parameter converts to ( ie. if num = 63 then the output should be 1:3).  Separate the number of hours and minutes with a colon.

//First attempt

function timeConver ( num ) {

	var hours, mins;
	
	if ( ( num % 60 ) >= 1 ) { //If num >= 60, hours will be calculated else hours is 0
		hours = Math.floor( num / 60 ); //Used Math.floor to remove decimals after division
		mins = num % 60; 
		
		if ( mins < 10 ) { //My inner OCD required a formatting clause when numbers were less than 10
			mins = "0" + mins;
		}
	} else { //If num < 60 then there is no need to calculate hours and mins will always = num
		hours = 0;
		mins = num;
	}

	return hours + ":" + mins;

}

//The first attempt is quite inefficient as it declares 2 extra variables and contains 2 loops.

//Revised attempt

function timeConver ( num ) {
	var mins = num % 60; //Any number less than 60 will cause mins = num
	num -= mins; //If num is <60, will cause num (aka hours) to be 0
	
	return ( ( num / 60 ) + ":" + mins );
	
	
}
